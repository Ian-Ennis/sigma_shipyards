# Sigma Shipyards

Project concept: It's the year 2089. The earth is no longer habitable as the atmosphere simply become too toxic. The last hope for humanity to survive is by reaching distant star systems with potentially-habitable planets! Private companies are creating their own orbital shipyards left and right, and one in particular has asked me to lead construction of their fleet. They have three star systems selected already. All I have to do is build a suitable ship and try to reach one of the systems.

# User Stories

As a user, I can login to the site, and create an account if I haven't done so yet. Once logged in, I can read about how I've been selected for a special mission. I can select a star system to travel to. I can then select a pre-built ship or create a new ship and add it to my inventory. Using credits in my account, I can purchase parts based on their cost and attributes. Doing so will alter my ship statistics and lower my available balance. I can save my ship, or scrap it and start over.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

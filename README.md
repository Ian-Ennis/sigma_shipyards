# Sigma Shipyards

Project concept: It's the year 2089, and things really aren't looking good. It's the year 2089. The earth is no longer habitable as the atmosphere simply become too toxic. The last hope for humanity to survive is by reaching distant star systems with potentially-habitable planets! Private companies are creating their own orbital shipyards left and right, and one in particular has asked me to lead construction of their fleet. They have three star systems selected already. All I have to do is build a suitable ship and try to reach one of the systems.

# User Stories

Minimum viable product: As a user, I can login to the site, and create an account if I haven't done so yet. Once logged in, I can opt to create a new ship using credits in my account to purchase parts based on their cost and attributes, have them added to my ship frame. Doing so will alter my ship statistics and lower my available balance. The ship will be visible with the clicked parts being rendered/attached. If I've already created a ship, I can either modify or delete it, or create a new ship entirely and add it to my collection. 

Stretch goal: I have been tasked with piloting the ship to the other star systems. As a user, I can select one of three star systems to fly to, based on distance and inherent dangers along the flight path. Once I click "embark", I can navigate my ship up or down the screen as interstellar dangers head my way. It's my job to surive the journey with the ship I have made. Collisions with objects will lower my shields, and my fuel reserves are limited. I will either live or die.. These results can be viewed on the mission accomplishments and failures page. Can I survive the journey?.. Will I be the one to save humanity?..

# Developer notes (for later)...

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

<<<<<<< HEAD


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

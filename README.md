# Sigma Shipyards


## Project concept: 

It's the year 2089. The earth is no longer habitable as the atmosphere simply become too toxic. The last hope for humanity to survive is by reaching distant star systems with potentially-habitable planets! Private companies are creating their own orbital shipyards left and right, and one in particular has asked me to lead construction of their fleet. They have three star systems selected already. All I have to do is build a suitable ship.

Sigma Shipyards is a wink and a nod to a 90's game called Escape Velocity by Ambrosia Software.

## User Stories

As a user, I can login to the site, and create an account if I haven't done so yet. Once logged in, I can read about how I've been selected for a special mission. I can select a star system to set my spaceship parameters to. I can then select a pre-built ship or create a new ship and add it to my inventory. Using credits in my account, I can purchase parts based on their cost and attributes. Doing so will alter my ship statistics and lower my available balance. I can save my ship, or scrap it and start over.

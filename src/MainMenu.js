        It's the year 2089, and things really aren't looking good. Scientists
        have discovered the sun is readying to release an insurvivable solar
        flare! Humanity's last hope to continue onwards is by reaching other
        star systems with habitable planets. Private companies are creating
        their own orbital shipyards left and right, and one in particular has
        asked me to lead construction of their fleet. They have three star
        systems selected already. All I have to do is build a suitable ship and
        try to reach one of the systems.{" "}
